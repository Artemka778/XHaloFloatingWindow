XHaloFloatingWindow (XHFW)
---------

#### Important Instructions
To compile this module,  you would need to have internal API's. The dependency on internal API would be slowly removed since it is very troublesome for every developer that wants to clone this. 

If you would like to help convert some internal API imports into reflective codes, you may do so and send a pull request.



* Download the already modified [Internal API 16][2]
* Place the downloaded internal API 16 in your platforms folder such that it looks something like this:
    * **(android-sdk-folder)/platforms/android-16-internals/**
* In Eclipse (or your favorite IDE), select **-16** for the API for XHFW.
* [Read this guide to modify ADT to use the Internal APIs][1]
    * You only need to follow Step 4. (Unless you want to know more about internal APIs)
